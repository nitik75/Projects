Title: To do List Maker

Description:
This is a Todo List Maker built with C++ programming language, it is a simple and efficient command-line application designed to help users create, organize and manage their tasks effectively.
It allows users to add, update task completion status, sort tasks by priority/due date/completion status as per user's wish, and maintain their to-do lists with ease. 
We have also added color coding to represent different priority levels in the display of the to do list. The priority levels are represented by different colors to visually distinguish tasks based on their importance. Tasks with higher priority levels are displayed in more eye-catchingÂ colors.
